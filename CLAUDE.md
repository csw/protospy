# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

If `CLAUDE.local.md` exists in this directory, read it for additional local guidance.

## Project Overview

`protospy` is a Rust HTTP monitoring proxy, which functions as a transparent reverse proxy for development purposes, allowing a user to interactively monitor traffic with a React UI. It uses Cargo edition 2024. This is human-written; agents should not attempt to write or modify any Rust code.

Sub-components are self-contained subprojects with their own virtualenvs, package definitions (uv or pnpm), dependencies, READMEs, CLAUDE.md files, etc. **Read the subproject's CLAUDE.md when working in it:**

- `conformance/` — HTTP reverse proxy conformance test suite (Python). See `conformance/CLAUDE.md` and `conformance/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- `demo/` — elasticflix demo app for realistic traffic (Python 3.14+, uv). See `demo/CLAUDE.md` and `demo/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- `ui/` — React/TypeScript UI for traffic inspection. See `ui/CLAUDE.md` and `ui/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Agents must not make any changes to the Rust code at any time.

## Commands (Rust root)

```bash
cargo build          # build
cargo run            # run
cargo test           # run all tests
cargo test <name>    # run a single test by name
cargo clippy         # lint
```

For subproject commands, see the subproject's CLAUDE.md.

### GitHub

Use the GitHub CLI via the read-only `gh-ro` wrapper (`~/bin/gh-ro`) instead of `gh`.

## Documentation

**When in doubt about how to use a tool or library, consult its documentation first — via Context7 or a web search. Do this before reading library source code, before trial-and-error, and before reasoning from first principles about implementation details. If something doesn't work as expected, your first action should be to look it up, not to read the source.**

## Specific guidelines

There are specific agent guidelines in `docs/agents/`; read them when working with the relevant kind of code.

- `docs/agents/python.md`: when working with Python
- `docs/agents/testing.md`: when writing or maintaining tests
- `docs/agents/sandbox.md`: when a sandboxed command fails with a TLS, keychain, or Mach-port error, or when setting up Monitor / background polling

## Delegating noisy investigation to subagents

Repetitive, high-output investigation steps with low long-term value should be delegated to a subagent on a smaller model (e.g. Haiku) rather than run inline. Pulling raw `ps`/`lsof`/`netstat`/`grep`/log-tail output into the primary context burns the window fast and rarely retains anything worth keeping a turn later.

Delegate when the work looks like:
- "Which process is listening on port X?" — port/process/PID lookups
- Sweeping logs, journals, or large command outputs for a needle
- Repeated probing (try a command, inspect output, try another) where only the conclusion matters
- Any loop where you find yourself running the same family of commands more than twice

Brief the subagent with the specific question and ask it to report only the answer (e.g. "report the PID and command, under 50 words"). Keep inline only the steps whose full output you genuinely need to see.

## Code Quality Requirements

Before reporting a unit of work as complete or committing code changes, ensure the code quality checks pass. Each subproject's CLAUDE.md lists the specific commands to run. This applies even to trivial changes like type annotations.

**Any code path not covered by the test suite must be executed manually before committing.** For example, if you change a CLI `main()` function, start the server and confirm it runs. Do not rely on linting or type-checking alone as a substitute for actually running the code.

## Committing

All commit messages must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `build`, `test`, `refactor`. Scope is optional but use it where it helps (e.g. `demo`, `conformance`, `ui`).

Each subproject's CLAUDE.md has additional commit guidance (e.g. lockfile handling). Read it before committing subproject changes.

## Versioning dependencies

When adding any dependency — Python packages, npm packages, GitHub Actions, CDN scripts, pre-commit hooks, Docker images, etc. — use the **current version** at the time of addition and pin it:

- **Python packages** (`pyproject.toml`): pin to the current major version, e.g. `"fastapi>=0,<1"`, `"pytest>=9,<10"`.
- **CDN scripts** (`<script src="...">`): pin to an explicit version, e.g. `htmx.org@2.0.4`, `alpinejs@3.14.1`. Never use `@latest` or a bare major like `@3`.
- **GitHub Actions** (`uses: owner/action@...`): pin to the current release tag, e.g. `actions/checkout@v4`.
- **Pre-commit hooks** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`): use a frozen SHA from `pre-commit autoupdate --freeze`.
- **Docker images** (`docker-compose.yaml`): pin to a specific version tag, e.g. `elasticsearch:9.3.1`. Never use `:latest`.

When you add a dependency you are uncertain about the current version of, look it up rather than guessing.

## CI

When investigating a failed GitHub Actions run, read `docs/ci-debugging.md` before starting.
